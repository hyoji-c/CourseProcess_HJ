                  <p>
                    Is The Internet Down? is a poetic exploration of the culture and history of the internet. In their essay, Kathleen and Chris Sleboda come up with a variety of approaches to the internet: what it means and how it is represented. Pick a detail from the text (an anecdote, a historical detail or a definition) and explain the implications this example carries for the internet at large. How would you define online culture if your chosen example was the axiom? In other words, draw from your example to create a summative statement about the internet and its culture. Do you agree with your summarization or do you feel that something is missing?

                    In this reading, I found content(or a piece of evidence) that was very sympathetic to my usual thoughts. It is a correlation between the Internet and people's happiness. These days, people are not afraid to express everything about themselves on social media. So there is a much more sensitive and complicated problem than before the Internet developed. I mean, it is not that the problem about showing itself. The real problem is posting overinflated lies. According to a Canadian study, the scale of online networks has little to do with how people feel subjective well-being in real "offline" lives. After all, the Internet is just the Internet.
                    Suppose the number of likes button is high and the number of followers rises significantly. Can it ultimately change our lives more "happily"? Unfortunately, social networking sites on the Internet are not the magic keys to changing our reality right now. From a different angle, these days, when you look at the phenomenon of so-called "hotshots" on the Internet, such as "YouTubers" and "Twitch Streamers," it seems appropriate to instill fantasies in people when you see them making billions and spending on expensive watches, houses and cars.
                    Most people who work at a company are under the illusion that hotshot people make money easily by looking at their lives. People especially feel jealous if they are the same age as the hotshot. I sometimes have this conversation with my friends. Beauty YouTubers are great for getting a lot of free cosmetics as a sponsorship and making money. I empathize with my friends in some texts. But it's a world where what looks like isn't everything. Everything in the world is like two sides of a coin. If my life changes positively compared to theirs, I am ready to use the Internet every day. However, social media's reality is not as fantastic as people expect. I know that.
                    We need to rethink the frequency and purpose of using the Internet. People should have a clear baseline when they use the Internet. As you can read in the reading, social media is not healthy but fun. In the endless flow of algorithmic supplies, people want to look away but can't. It is by repeating the terrible habit of constantly gnawing at the soul while aspiring to a world they cannot reach. The movement to make us a better person, or a better place in our world, takes place in reality.

                    These days, we cannot think of the world we live in apart from the Internet. So we have to be more vigilant. Would you be depressed and lower your self-esteem by looking at information that might be true or not? Or whether you will leave your electronic device, get off the Internet, and join the people you love offline depends solely on your choice.
                    I was particularly attracted to Figure 10 and Figure 12. It is an artwork that intuitively shows the connection between the Internet and happiness. The meaning of these posters is equivalent to thousands of essays. For example, if you look at Fig.12, it is a suicide knot made of an Internet cable. Can you see only the 'internet cable' from this artwork? No. You can think about the meaning of that cable. I immediately thought of the Internet's impact on people, depression, and suicide. Visualizing the meaning the magazine wants to convey to its readers is important. Sometimes, a picture can give us a more powerful message than a few hundred pieces of writing. This magazine can provide readers with a pretty deep meaning about the Internet. I think photos, posters, and typography are appropriately positioned to fit the story's theme. I enjoyed reading this magazine.
