                  <p>
                    I decided to re-design the 'PANTONE' website. PANTONE is my favourite company. However, it is a company related to 'colour,' and I felt the website design was very typical. Quite a lot of content is just too much on one page, and overall it has too old website designs. A lot of content means there are a lot of images and text. I focus on re-design to handle these points. When you browse the website from a user's point of view, there are quite some inconveniences in terms of UX. Such as the little arrows(*it's hard to click) and many highlighted letters(*it makes me feel dizzy).
                    <br>
                    The attached photo below is the PANTONE website of the U.S. and Korea, and although they share the same content in general, there are some differences, including the header part. Therefore, I plan to re-design by collecting the points that need to be improved on the two sites.
