                  <p>The writer implicitly tells the past, present and future of the cloud. Among them, I was most impressed by the expressions related to privacy. <br> So I made a poster inspired by the phrase below.</p>
                  <p class="q3">
                    "Today one need not go far to find headlines like that on the February 2014 cover of Popular Mechanics : ‚Äú Privacy Is Disappearing: How New Tech Tools Can Help You Fight Back. ‚Äù As ever more data moves into the cloud, the general public has increasingly become aware that the cloud is politically contested terrain; articles on data-veillance and cell phone tracking routinely run in the popular media. Yet typical responses to this debate invoke technological and legal solutions, such as do-not-track software or a new law; the Popular Mechanics article, for example, tells users to reclaim their privacy by installing encryption software and ‚Äú practicing good browser hygiene.‚Äù The problem with this approach, however, is that it does little to address the wider political and social context from which these problems ‚Äî and even the very idea of privacy ‚Äî originate; nor does it take in account the logics behind technology itself that actually reproduce and redouble the problem of privacy."
