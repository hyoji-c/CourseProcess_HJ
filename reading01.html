        </h1>


              <h1 class="question02">Q1. Why doesÂ Laura Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h1>
                  <p class="about__description">
                    I very much agree with Laura's attitude in defending the website. She makes it clear that social media puts advertising before users' needs. I understand that the user's happiness is not the primary purpose; it is just a tool created by capitalism. Also, her argument about each website's duality is interesting to me. Evaluating the infinite possibilities of a website was the same as what I had about it. Usually, I enjoy SNS very much, but I am the type of person who doesn't post. When I do SNS, I see accounts run by companies and people in the field I am interested in rather than my family and friends' thoughts and daily lives. Those posts are about the 'future thing,' that is, the purpose of promotion. These create an effortless flow that makes the user palatable but eventually leads to consumption. I'm so sick of this algorithm of capitalism. So I sometimes reflect on what it was like before the Internet was less developed and SNS was created, and I miss those days. They had no qualms about professionally revealing their tastes. For example, text, photos, website designs, and even fonts. But these days, all kinds of SNS postings are standardized, and no matter how new the topic is, it feels similar. (*Of course, it's my personal opinion.) Laura described the website as an individual act of collective ambition. After all, the website is also just essential to appeal to the public. However, it would be best if you did not forget that the website is a space where you can develop your dreams and artistry.

              <h1 class="question02">Q2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Can you use a metaphor for describing the internet you inhabit? How does it differ from Schwulst's?</h1>
                  <p class="about__description">
                    Considering my tendency to use the Internet and my personality, I am the type to use the website as a garden. The phrase, "Gardens have had their own ways each season," touched me. To be honest, I don't reveal myself on the Internet. It's been a while since I posted on SNS. I don't want to share my private life with everyone. However, I have created and run my website because of my career. I'm using the portfolio and my website at the same time. So I don't dress up my website daily like common SNS. When my ideas and works are ready, I upload them. My website looks like a garden that has lost its vitality in the winter and blooms in the spring. The point that I'm going to make here is that I don't think the portfolio belongs to the category of the website Laura is talking about. Because showing my work is directly related to achieving my goal anyway, and I don't have only pure intentions after all. Someday, I want to create a website where I can discuss my tastes and expertise with people purely. But I think I'll feel more and more as time goes by that it's challenging to hold people's attention focused. There are already a lot of instant posts, and the world is racing at a fast pace online.                  </p>
